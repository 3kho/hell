# Importing 
Different ways to import - 
vercel doesnt work.


Netlify


Replit

# Replit

Choose to import from github. In the left side, it should say node.js

Press Node.js and change it to html css javascript.

Then, import it.

This github file is very large, so there is a slim chance that its importable to 
replit.
